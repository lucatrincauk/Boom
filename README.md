## Development
Application built as a personal project during my spare time at M&S.
The app lets you browse through the current week’s menu at the two M&S canteens and rate or favourite individual dishes. It also features an administration panel where it’s possible to add, edit or remove dishes. The dishes cycle through fixed rotas so small maintenance is needed.
